> **Learning Path → Course → Chapter → Lesson** is the core structure.  
Each level uses `_index.md` and lessons use `.md` files with [Hugo frontmatter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

## Content Authoring Workflow

1. **Create Content**

   - Authoring takes place inside:
     ```
     content/en/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/
     ```
   - Structure:
     ```
     <learning-path>/
      <course>/
        <chapter>/
            content/
              lesson1.md
              lesson2.md
     ```

   - **Frontmatter Required** (example for any `_index.md` or lesson .md):

     ```yaml
     ---
     title: "Title of Section or Lesson"
     description: "One-liner summary"
     weight: 10  # for menu order, lower numbers appear first
     ---
     ```

2. **Delete Example Content**
   - Remove any demo/example files not relevant to your new material.

3. **Organize Lessons**
   - Add new folders and markdown files for each learning path, course, chapter, and lesson.

## Managing Assets (Images & Videos)

Enhance your courses with images and rich visual content. For compatibility with the Layer5 Academy’s multi-tenant architecture, **do not use standard Markdown image links**. Use shortcodes as described below.

### How to Add an Image

1. Place your image (example: `exoscale-logo.png`) in the organization’s static directory:

    ```
    static/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/images/exoscale-logo.png
    ```

2. In lesson markdown, embed your image using the `usestatic` shortcode (path is relative to your org’s folder):

    ```markdown
    ![Exoscale Logo]({{</* usestatic path="images/exoscale-logo.png" */>}})
    ```

> When you build the site, this shortcode automatically resolves to a working, tenant-aware asset path.

### How to Add a Video

Embed videos in a visually distinct `card` using:

```markdown
{{</* card title="Video: Example" */>}}
<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
    <source src="https://example.com/your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
{{</* /card */>}}
```

> Always use these shortcodes for images and videos so assets remain portable, visible, and cloud-ready.

## Local Development

To preview your content locally, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

- Open the local URL displayed in your terminal browser.
- Local preview uses plain styling; full Layer5 Cloud branding is applied on production.

## Deploying & Going Live

1. **Commit and push** your changes to a branch or `main`.
2. **Contact Layer5** via [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/), email, or by opening a GitHub issue.
3. Provide your repository URL.
4. Once reviewed, a Layer5 admin will synchronize your content to the [Layer5 Cloud Academy](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/overview).
