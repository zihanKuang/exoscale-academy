# Exoscale Academy

Welcome to **Exoscale Academy**, the dedicated cloud education and training platform powered by Layer5. This repository provides a comprehensive framework for creating, organizing, and publishing structured learning paths, courses, and lessons tailored for Exoscale users and cloud practitioners.

可用资源：https://meshery.io/catalog/models/exoscale-icons
use https://meshery.io/assets/modelsFiles/exoscale-icons.tar  in the [meshery model import](https://kanvas.new/settings?settingsCategory=Registry&tab=Models) from url and the make designs with it.

## Design Resources

To help you create professional and visually consistent content, this academy provides the official **Exoscale Icons** model for building custom architecture diagrams.

> You can preview the full collection of icons anytime on the [**Meshery Catalog**](https://meshery.io/catalog/models/exoscale-icons).

### How to Use the Icons

1.  **Import the Model:** Navigate to your **[Registry Settings in Meshery](https://kanvas.new/settings?settingsCategory=Registry&tab=Models)**.
2.  Select "Import from URL".
3.  Paste the following URL to import the icon set:
    ```
    https://meshery.io/assets/modelsFiles/exoscale-icons.tar
    ```

Once imported, the individual Exoscale icons will be available in the Designer's **shapes** palette for you to use.

> **Learning Path → Course → Chapter → Lesson** is the core structure.  
Each level uses `_index.md` and lessons use `.md` files with [Hugo frontmatter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).

## Content Authoring Workflow

1. **Create Content**

   - Authoring takes place inside:
     ```
     content/en/learning-paths/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/
     ```
   - Structure:
     ```
     <learning-path>/
      <course>/
        <chapter>/
            content/
              lesson1.md
              lesson2.md
     ```

   - **Frontmatter Required** (example for any `_index.md` or lesson .md):

     ```yaml
     ---
     title: "Title of Section or Lesson"
     description: "One-liner summary"
     weight: 10  # for menu order, lower numbers appear first
     ---
     ```

2. **Delete Example Content**
   - Remove any demo/example files not relevant to your new material.

3. **Organize Lessons**
   - Add new folders and markdown files for each learning path, course, chapter, and lesson.

## Managing Assets: Images, Videos, and Embedded Designs

Enhance your courses with images and rich visual content. For compatibility with the Layer5 Academy’s multi-tenant architecture, **do not use standard Markdown image links**. Use shortcodes as described below.

### How to Add an Image

1. Place your image (example: `exoscale-logo.png`) in the organization’s static directory:

    ```
    static/98e16360-a366-4b78-8e0a-031da07fdacb/images/exoscale-logo.png
    ```

2. In lesson markdown, embed your image using the `usestatic` shortcode (path is relative to your org’s folder):

    ```markdown
    ![Exoscale Logo]({{</* usestatic path="images/exoscale-logo.png" */>}})
    ```

> When you build the site, this shortcode automatically resolves to a working, tenant-aware asset path.

### How to Add a Video

Embed videos in a visually distinct `card` using:

```markdown
{{</* card title="Video: Example" */>}}
<video width="100%" height="100%" controls>
    <source src="https://example.com/your-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
{{</* /card */>}}
```
## How to Add a Meshery Design

1. Place Design Assets  
   Put your design files (e.g., `cdn.js`, design YAMLs) alongside your course or lesson content, ideally following the same directory conventions used for images.

2. Embed Using the meshery-design-embed Shortcode  
   In your lesson markdown, use:
  
  ```markdown
  {{< meshery-design-embed
  id="embedded-design-0e3abb9c-39e7-4d09-b46f-26a0238c3c3d"
  src="cdn.js"
  >}}
  ```

   - Replace `id` with the unique identifier for your design.
   - Replace `src` with the path to your JS asset responsible for rendering.

> Always use these shortcodes for images, videos, and embedded designs. This keeps assets portable, ensures they resolve correctly for each organization, and integrates properly with the Academy platform’s build and deployment flow.

## Local Development

To preview your content locally, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

- Open the local URL displayed in your terminal browser.
- Local preview uses plain styling; full Layer5 Cloud branding is applied on production.

## Deploying & Going Live

1. **Commit and push** your changes to a branch or `main`.
2. **Contact Layer5** via [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/), email, or by opening a GitHub issue.
3. Provide your repository URL.
4. Once reviewed, a Layer5 admin will synchronize your content to the [Layer5 Cloud Academy](https://cloud.layer5.io/academy/overview).
