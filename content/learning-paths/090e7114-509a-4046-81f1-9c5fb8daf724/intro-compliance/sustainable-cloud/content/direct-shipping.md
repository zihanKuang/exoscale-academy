### **Overview**

We ship our **servers directly** from the distributor to our data centers, **avoiding unnecessary** equipment **transport** and **reducing** our **carbon footprint**.

### **Benefits**

Direct shipping refers to shipping goods directly from the manufacturer or supplier to the customer, without any intermediaries such as wholesalers or retailers. In this method, the manufacturer or supplier handles the entire shipping process, including packaging, labeling, and delivery. Direct shipping is often used by e-commerce businesses that sell products online, allowing them to reduce costs and streamline their operations. It also allows for faster delivery times and greater control over the customer experience.

Direct shipping can have a positive impact on sustainability in several ways:

- **Reduced carbon footprint** - Direct shipping eliminates the need for intermediaries, which can reduce the carbon footprint associated with transportation and logistics.

- **Less packaging waste** - Direct shipping can lead to less packaging waste, as the manufacturer or supplier can use more sustainable packaging materials and avoid the need for additional packaging from intermediaries.

- **Efficient use of resources** - Direct shipping allows manufacturers and suppliers to be more efficient in using resources, as they can control the entire shipping process and optimize their operations accordingly.
