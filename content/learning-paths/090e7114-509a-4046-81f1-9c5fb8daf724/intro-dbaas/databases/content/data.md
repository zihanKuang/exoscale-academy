### **Data**

Data is the fuel of our society. Can we agree on that? There were many bold statements over the years to underline the importance of data. Data is the new oil; Data is the new gold; all variations you have probably come across if you follow the news, media, or social media. Data is the new water - is a fresh analogy you can find in researching the data topic.

" Like water, data needs to be accessible, it needs to be clean, and it is needed to survive." - Dan Vesset (IDC)

*Data Word Cloud*

The water analogy is probably more appealing because we should be more fond of water than gold or oil for many reasons, but it is pretty evident from a pure survival point of view.
We are getting back to our core topic data and databases. The collection of (important) data in the past and storing it in databases for reuse and archiving it for preservation is as old as humanity. For example, the Sumerians already used clay tablets to keep the index of medical prescriptions as a form of database, so databases started long before computers were even invented.
The increase in the volume of data we produce every year has reached an almost frightening value. The digital revolution induces the reason for this exponential increase in data production. Keeping track and oversight in this data situation, we have to improve and invent new data tools, or otherwise, we would get lost in data.
