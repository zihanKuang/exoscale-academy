### EU CSRD

- Sustainability Reporting Regulation
- Green Deal Expansion
- CSRD Rollout Complexity
- Driving Sustainable Economy
- Demystifying Corporate Sustainability

### Sustainability Reporting Regulation

The European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is a significant regulatory development aimed at enhancing and standardizing the sustainability reporting by companies.

### Green Deal Expansion

Building on the foundations of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the CSRD was proposed by the European Commission in April 2021 as part of the EU's Green Deal and Sustainable Finance Agenda.

### CSRD Rollout Complexity

The CSRD's implementation originally set for 2024 (FY 2023) for NFRD companies, faces potential delays due to standard complexity and legal preparations, with new companies reporting from 2025 (FY 2024) onwards based on size and NFRD status.

### Driving Sustainable Economy

As a key component of the EU's sustainable finance agenda, the CSRD aims to foster a more sustainable economy by enhancing transparency, accountability, and promoting sustainable corporate practices. 

### Demystifying Corporate Sustainability

Its goal is to make sustainability information more accessible worldwide, helping investors, consumers, and policymakers understand companies' green efforts. This enables smarter decisions and promotes eco-friendly practices.
