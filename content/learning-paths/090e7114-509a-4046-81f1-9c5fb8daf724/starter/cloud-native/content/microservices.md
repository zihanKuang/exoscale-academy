### **Explained**

![microservices]({{< usestatic "starter/microservices.png" >}})

Microservice architecture is a software development approach that structures an application as a collection of small, independent, and loosely coupled services.

Each service is designed to perform a specific business function and communicates with other services through well-defined APIs. Microservices are typically deployed independently and can be scaled individually, allowing for greater flexibility and agility in software development. The microservice architecture emphasizes modularity, resilience, and fault tolerance and is often used in cloud-native and DevOps environments.

One of the main advantages of microservice architecture is that it allows for greater agility and flexibility in software development. Since each service is independent, changes can be made to one service without affecting the others, making testing and deploying new features more accessible. Additionally, microservices can be scaled independently, allowing businesses to allocate resources where they are needed most. This can result in cost savings and improved performance. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to microservice architecture. For example, managing multiple services can be complex and require high team coordination and communication. Additionally, microservices can introduce additional points of failure, making it more difficult to troubleshoot and diagnose issues. Despite these challenges, microservice architecture is becoming increasingly popular in modern software development, allowing businesses to build more flexible, scalable, and resilient applications.
