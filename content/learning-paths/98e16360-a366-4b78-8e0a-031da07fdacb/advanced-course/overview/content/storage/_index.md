Exoscale's Simple Object Storage (SOS) is a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing and managing large amounts of data. It offers highly available multi-redundancy storage, ensuring data safety and accessibility. You can store various files and objects, such as assets, backups, and media files.

The S3-compatible API allows for easy integration with existing workflows and applications. SOS provides low latency, high bandwidth, and secure HTTP(s) access, allowing fast and secure data management from any location. You can enhance this with Exoscale's CDN integration.
