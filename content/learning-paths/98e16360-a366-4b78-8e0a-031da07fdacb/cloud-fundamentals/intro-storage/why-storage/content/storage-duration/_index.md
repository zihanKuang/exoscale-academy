### Explained

Storage Duration or Data Retention refers to the period of time that data is stored and maintained in a system or storage medium. It represents the duration for which data is preserved and remains accessible for retrieval or reference.

Data retention policies are typically defined by organizations to determine how long different types of data should be retained. These policies are influenced by various factors, including legal requirements, industry regulations, business needs, and data management best practices.

The purpose of data retention is to ensure that data is available for future use, analysis, compliance, or reference. It helps organizations meet legal and regulatory obligations, support business operations, facilitate data analysis and reporting, and address potential disputes or investigations.

Data retention periods can vary depending on the type of data and the specific requirements of the organization or industry. For example, financial records may need to be retained for a certain number of years, while customer data may have different retention requirements.

It is important for organizations to establish clear data retention policies and procedures to ensure compliance, data integrity, and efficient data management throughout the data lifecycle.
