### Remote-First Approach

Exoscale is a broadly distributed company. We believe in a **remote-first approach** to work, which helps **reduce** the impact of maintaining a **traditional office space**, such as **energy consumption**, **waste production**, and **commuting emissions**.

### Waste Heat Utilization

Always looking for new and innovative ways to minimize our environmental impact, we have started using the **waste heat generated by our lab** infrastructure **to heat our Lausanne office** space **in** the **winter** months.

### Personal Commitment

Our **employees are eager to reduce their environmental impact**. For example, many of our employees have been increasingly relying on trains to travel to our offsite meetings, which helps **reduce air travel** emissions. In addition, many employees use **public transportation**, **biking**, and electric vehicles to commute to work.

### Leading Sustainability

This combination of remote work and environmental awareness is just one of the many ways **Exoscale leads the way in sustainable business practices**.

Our **commitment to sustainability** is a core **part of our company culture**. It drives everything we do, from our technology to our work.
