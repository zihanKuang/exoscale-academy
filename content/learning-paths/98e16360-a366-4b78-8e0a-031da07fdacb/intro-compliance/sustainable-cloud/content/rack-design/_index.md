### Overview

By packing more servers and other equipment into high-density racks, **Exoscale reduces** its **overall data center footprint** and the associated costs of building and maintaining a larger facility. In addition, smaller data centers require less energy to power and cool.

### Benefits

The high-density rack design is an approach to the layout and organization of server racks in a data center that maximizes the computing power that can be packed into a given space. This is achieved through specialized equipment and techniques for greater power and cooling efficiency, better cable management, and airflow.

High-density racks typically feature a more significant number of servers per rack than traditional designs, with each server consuming more power and generating more heat. High-density racks often incorporate hot-aisle/cold-aisle containment, in-row cooling units, and high-efficiency power supplies to accommodate this.

The benefits of high-density rack design include increased computing power, reduced footprint and energy consumption, and lower overall costs. However, it also requires careful planning and maintenance to ensure that the equipment remains cool and functional and has good power and cooling infrastructure to support the higher density.
