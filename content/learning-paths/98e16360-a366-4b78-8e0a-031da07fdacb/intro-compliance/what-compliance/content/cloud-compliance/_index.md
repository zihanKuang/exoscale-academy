### Definition

Cloud Compliance is the art and science of complying with regulatory standards of cloud usage following industry guidelines and local, national, and international laws, like:

- PCI DSS protects credit card information handling
- HIPAA protects a patient's healthcare information
- SOX protects the financial information of public companies
- GLBA protects the data of financial institution customers
- ...

However, they all share a unified goal: **keeping sensitive data secure.**

### Security is a Shared Responsibility

Cloud involves infrastructure the organization doesn't own and manage. Hence, many **organizations share responsibility with cloud providers** for access control.

The **cloud provider** updates and controls access to the components it administers, including the host operating system, virtualization software, hardware, and facilities.

The **organization**, in turn, retains responsibility for updating, patching, and controlling access to the components it layers on top of the cloud infrastructure—applications, guest operating systems, and security software.

The organization's responsibility includes configuring any firewall services provided by the cloud provider that the organization uses for policy enforcement.

This partnership is often described as:

- cloud provider is responsible for the security of the cloud
- organization is responsible for the access to its resources in the cloud
