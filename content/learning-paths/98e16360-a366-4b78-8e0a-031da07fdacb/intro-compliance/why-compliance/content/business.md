#### Enhancing customer trust
When customers know a company complies with the law and quality standards, they're more likely to trust the brand and purchase its products and services. This is possible because they understand that the law protects their interests and health, and the standards set by the company consider their preferences and expectations. Enhancing customer trust is one of the most important goals of an organization, as this can improve brand awareness and avoid complaints and product returns. This can help a business increase its revenue, improve its reputation, avoid adverse publicity, and expand its customer base.

#### Increasing business revenue
When a company demonstrates compliance, other businesses might purchase a high volume of its products, allowing it to increase its business-to-business operations. This is possible because most companies want to buy regulated products and avoid the risks associated with non-regulated items. Customers also tend to buy more products and services from companies that follow set rules because they understand they are not offering illegal or dangerous products. In addition, they can verify the quality standards the company is using and how it's meeting them.

#### Protecting the company from legal action
Lawsuits are usually filed against a company if unsatisfied customers or the public discover the business is avoiding regulations to save money in operations costs or generate more profit. By complying with regulations, companies can protect themselves from legal action and demonstrate that they've been operating according to the law. Inspections from regulatory agencies are necessary, as they can corroborate that the company is following all legal requirements. It's also imperative that the company ensures its employees have the proper certifications and receive adequate training.

#### Improving internal processes
Compliance officers can improve the company's internal processes by ensuring employees understand and follow the policies. They create training programs or ask suppliers and vendors to provide each employee with the training required to operate specific equipment. Companies usually establish standards, codes, and procedures to benefit their operations, guarantee quality levels, and ensure the safety of their employees. This way, the company provides that the processes involved in its daily operations follow a procedure and that emergency protocols are in place to prevent accidents and non-programmed shutdowns.

#### Avoiding fines and penalties
When government agencies find a company violating a law, they can impose fines and penalties. Businesses can avoid these penalties and access government programs or legally granted benefits by complying with regulations. They can also evade legal costs or any other punishment that can stop their operations, affecting their marketing campaigns, sales, employees' morale, customer service, and investment in new equipment.
