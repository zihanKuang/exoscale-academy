### DEPLOYMENTS

A Deployment is a higher-order abstraction that controls deploying and maintaining a set of Pods. Behind the scenes, it uses a ReplicaSet to keep the Pods running, but it offers sophisticated logic for deploying, updating, and scaling a set of Pods within a cluster. Deployments support rollbacks and rolling updates. Rollouts can be paused if needed.
