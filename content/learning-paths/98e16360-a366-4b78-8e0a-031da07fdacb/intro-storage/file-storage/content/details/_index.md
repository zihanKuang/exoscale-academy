### **Explained**

File storage has been around for considerably longer than object or block storage. It is something most people are familiar with. You name your files, place them in folders, and nest them under more folders to form a set path. This way, files are organized into a hierarchy, with directories and sub-directories. Each file also has a limited set of metadata associated with it, such as the file name, the date it was created, and the date it was last modified.

Hierarchical file storage is practical for organizing structured data. This works well up to a point, but as capacity grows, the file model becomes burdensome for two reasons. First, performance suffers beyond a certain capacity. A NAS system has limited processing power, making the processor a bottleneck. Second, performance also suffers with the massive database – the file lookup tables – that accompany capacity growth.

Scaling requires adding more hardware or upgrading to higher-capacity devices, which can be costly. Cloud-based file storage services offer a solution by allowing multiple users to access and share files stored in off-site data centers. With a monthly subscription fee, you can keep your files in the cloud, quickly scale up capacity, and specify performance and protection criteria. Additionally, you save on the expense of maintaining on-site hardware since the cloud service provider manages the infrastructure.
### **Definition**

File storage in the cloud refers to the practice of storing and managing files on remote servers that are accessible via the Internet. Instead of saving files on local storage devices like hard drives or USB drives, cloud storage allows users to upload and store files on servers maintained by a cloud storage provider. These files can then be accessed, shared, and synced across multiple devices and platforms.

Examples of file cloud storage services include Dropbox, Google Drive, and Microsoft OneDrive. These services typically offer a certain amount of free storage, with additional storage available for a fee.

- Cloud File Storage: is a method for storing data in the cloud that provides servers and applications access to data through shared file systems. This compatibility makes cloud file storage ideal for workloads that rely on shared file systems and provides simple integration without code changes.
- Cloud File System: is a hierarchical storage system in the cloud that provides shared access to file data. Users can create, delete, modify, read, and write files, as well as organize them logically in directory trees for intuitive access.
- Cloud File Sharing: is a service that provides simultaneous access for multiple users to a common set of files stored in the cloud. Security for online file storage is managed with user and group permissions so administrators can control access to the shared file data.

### **Requirements for Cloud File Storage**

An ideal file-based data storage solution in the cloud must deliver the proper performance and capacity for today while also being capable of scaling as business needs change. The solution should include the following features:

- Performance: provides consistent throughput, scalable storage space, and low-latency performance
- Security: provides network security and access control permissions for sensitive data protection
- Affordability: pay only for capacity used with no upfront provisioning costs or licensing fees.
- Availability: Redundancy across multiple sites and always accessible when needed.
- Compatibility: integrates seamlessly with existing applications with no new code to write
- Fully Managed: provides a system that can be launched in minutes with no physical hardware required or ongoing software maintenance

### **Different Cloud File Storage Services**

The benefits of cloud file storage are clear, but it is important to note that not all cloud file storage solutions are created equal; various solutions exist. Cloud file storage can be delivered in one of two ways:

- through fully managed solutions with minimal setup and little to no maintenance or
- through do-it-yourself solutions with separate compute, storage, software, and licensing, which require staffed expertise to configure and maintain.
