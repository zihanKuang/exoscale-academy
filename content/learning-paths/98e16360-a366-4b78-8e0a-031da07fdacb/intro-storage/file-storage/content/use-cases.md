### **Overview**

Cloud file storage provides the flexibility to support and integrate with existing applications, plus the ease of deploying, managing, and maintaining all your files in the cloud. These two key advantages allow organizations to support various applications and verticals. Use cases such as large content repositories, development environments, media stores, and user home directories are ideal workloads for cloud-based file storage.

Here are some example use cases for file storage:

- Web Serving: The need for shared file storage for web-serving applications can be challenging when integrating backend applications. Typically, multiple web servers deliver a website’s content, each needing access to the same set of files. Since cloud file storage solutions adhere to standard file-level protocols, file naming conventions, and permissions that web developers are accustomed to, cloud file storage can be integrated into your web applications.
- Content Management: A content management system (CMS) requires a common namespace and access to a file system hierarchy. Like web-serving use cases, CMS environments typically have multiple servers that need access to the same set of files to serve up content. Since cloud file storage solutions adhere to the expected file system semantics, file naming conventions, and permissions that developers are accustomed to, storing documents and other files can be integrated into existing CMS workflows.
- Analytics: Analytics can require massive amounts of data storage that can scale further to keep up with growth. This storage must also provide the performance necessary to deliver data to analytics tools. Many analytics workloads interact with data through a file interface, rely on features like file locks, and require the ability to write to portions of a file. Since cloud-based file storage supports standard file-level protocols and can scale capacity and performance, it is ideal for delivering a file-sharing solution that is easy to integrate into existing big data and analytics workflows.
- Media and Entertainment: Digital media and entertainment workflows are constantly changing. Many businesses use a hybrid cloud deployment and need standardized access using file system protocols (NFS or SMB) or concurrent protocol access. These workflows require flexible, consistent, and secure access to data from off-the-shelf, custom-built, and partner solutions. Since cloud file storage adheres to existing file system semantics, storage of rich media content for processing and collaboration can be integrated for content production, digital supply chains, media streaming, broadcast play-out, analytics, and archives.
- Home Directories: The use of home directories for storing files only accessible by specific users and groups can be beneficial for many cloud workflows. Businesses looking to take advantage of the scalability and cost benefits of the cloud are extending access to home directories for many of their users. Since cloud file storage systems adhere to common file-level protocols and standard permissions models, customers can lift and shift applications to the cloud that need this capability.
- Database Backups: Backing up data using existing mechanisms, software, and semantics can create an isolated disaster recovery scenario with little locational flexibility for recovery. Many businesses want to take advantage of the flexibility of storing database backups in the cloud, either for temporary protection of previous versions during updates or for development and testing. Since cloud file storage presents a standard file system that can be mounted from database servers, it can be an ideal platform for creating portable database backups using native application tools or enterprise backup applications.
- Development Tools: Development environments can be challenged to share unstructured data safely and securely as they collaborate to develop their latest innovations. With the need to share code and other files in an organized way, using shared cloud file storage provides an organized and secure repository accessible within their cloud development environments. Cloud-based file storage delivers a scalable and highly available solution ideal for collaboration.
- End User Computing: End User Computing (EUC) is a combination of technologies that gives your employees secure, remote access to applications, desktops, and data they need to complete their work. Modern enterprises use EUC so their employees can work from wherever they are, across multiple devices, in a safe and scalable way. EUC technologies like persistent desktops and document management systems require secure, reliable, and scalable file storage systems.
