### Experience

![exo-scale]({{< usestatic "sec3-sub6-unit1-csrd-exo-1.png" >}})

Exoscale, a European cloud service provider, has developed a pioneering tool, CloudAssess, in collaboration with Resilio and Kleis, to show the environmental impact of customer's cloud usage transparently.

Exoscale integrated CloudAssess into its system, enriching billing data with lifecycle assessment (LCA) sustainability insights. Despite challenges in data acquisition and real-time reporting, they adapted processes to meet LCA needs, enhancing sustainability.

This effort showcases Exoscale's commitment to environmental responsibility and positions it as a sustainability leader in cloud services. Their success demonstrates the viability of sustainable operations and serves as an example for other providers.
