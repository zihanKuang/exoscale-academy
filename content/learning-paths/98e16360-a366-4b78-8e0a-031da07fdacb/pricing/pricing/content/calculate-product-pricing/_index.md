### **Calculate Product Pricing**

Usually, you want to know the cost for a resource on a monthly basis, like you know your cost for other subscriptions like your mobile data plan, Spotify, Netflix and so forth.

The official pricing can be found on the web exoscle.com/pricing and in the official price list. There you can find hourly pricing for the different products. In the Exoscale realm, we calculate with 720 hours per month, and other cloud providers use, e.g. 730 hours per month, this information is relevant if you want to compare monthly pricing.
