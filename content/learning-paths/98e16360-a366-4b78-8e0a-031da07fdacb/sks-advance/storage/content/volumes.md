### **Volumes**

Containerized (stateless) applications have the same needs as normal (stateless) applications. They need all types of storage to share, read, and access information. Attaching and sharing temporary storage to a Pod, respective to a container or multiple containers, is handled by the volume concept.

Different storage types can be mounted and used by containers, e.g., temporary volumes, network volumes, and configuration maps. The video below shows how volumes are defined and used in manifests, the configuration mechanism in Kubernetes.
