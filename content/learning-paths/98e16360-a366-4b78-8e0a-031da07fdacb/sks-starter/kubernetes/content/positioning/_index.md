### **Positoning**

#### **Kubernetes is ...**
... **providing** the building blocks for creating developer and infrastructure platforms but preserves user choice and flexibility where it is essential.

... **extensible**, and lets users integrate their logging, monitoring, alerting, and many more solutions because it is not monolithic, and these solutions are optional and pluggable.

#### **Kubernetes is NOT ...**
**... a traditional, all-inclusive PaaS system.**

Kubernetes operates at the container level rather than at the hardware level. It provides some generally helpful features common to PaaS offerings, such as deployment, scaling, load balancing.

**... a mere orchestration system.**

It eliminates the need for orchestration. The definition of orchestration is executing a defined workflow:

first, do A, then B, then C → imperative

Kubernetes comprises independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state:

towards the desired state → declarative

#### **Kubernetes does NOT ...**
**... limit the types of applications supported.**

Kubernetes aims to support a highly diverse workload, including stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads. If an application can run in a container, it should run great on Kubernetes.

**... deploy source code and does not build your application.**

Organizational cultures determine Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows and preferences and technical requirements.

**... provide application-level services;**

such as middleware, data-processing frameworks, databases, caches, nor cluster storage systems as built-in services. Application access the components mentioned above through portable mechanisms - both are running Kubernetes.

**...provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine management.**

The task requires additional components for system configuration, system management & maintenance, etc...
