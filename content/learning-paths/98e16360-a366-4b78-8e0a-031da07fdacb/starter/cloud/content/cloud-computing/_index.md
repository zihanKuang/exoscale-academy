### **Definition**

Cloud computing is a technology that allows users to access computing resources, such as servers, storage, and applications, over the Internet, without the need for on-site hardware or infrastructure.

That enables users to scale their computing resources up or down as needed and pay only for their use. It also allows for greater flexibility, mobility, and collaboration. In addition, users can access their data and applications anywhere with an Internet connection.

Cloud computing is used by businesses, individuals, and organizations of all sizes and across all industries to increase agility, improve efficiency and reduce costs.
