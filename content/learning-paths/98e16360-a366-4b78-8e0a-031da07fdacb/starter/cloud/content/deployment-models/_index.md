### **Explained**

### **Public Cloud**
Public Cloud is a cloud computing model where the service provider owns, manages, and maintains the physical infrastructure, such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage. Users access virtualized computing, networking, and storage resources as services, which can be quickly and easily provisioned and scaled as needed.

Public Cloud is accessible over the internet and is typically offered on a pay-per-use basis. It allows organizations to avoid the costs and complexities of managing their hardware and infrastructure and instead focus on their core business needs.

### **Private Cloud**
Private Cloud is a cloud computing model where the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. The infrastructure can be on-premises or on a public cloud, such as a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and is owned, managed, and operated by the organization or the cloud provider.

Private Cloud provides organizations greater control and security over their data and infrastructure and can be customized to meet their business needs.

### **Hybrid Cloud**
Hybrid Cloud is a cloud computing model in which an organization's on-premises private and third-party public cloud are connected as a single, flexible infrastructure. This allows organizations to leverage both Public and Private clouds' features and benefits and move workloads between them as needed.

As a result, the Hybrid cloud provides organizations with greater flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency while allowing them to maintain control over their data and infrastructure.
