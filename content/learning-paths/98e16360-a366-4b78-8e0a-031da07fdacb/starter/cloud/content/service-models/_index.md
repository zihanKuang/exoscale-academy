### **Explained**

Cloud services models refer to how cloud computing services are delivered to users. The three main cloud services models are:

**Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS):

Users access virtualized computing, networking, and storage resources as services, which are owned, managed, and maintained by the cloud provider. Users have complete control over the configuration and management of the virtualized resources.

**Platform as a Service** (PaaS):

Developers access a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud, including application development frameworks, databases, middleware, and other tools needed to build, test, and deploy applications.

**Software as a Service** (SaaS):

Users access software applications over the internet without the need for installation or maintenance. The application is hosted on the cloud provider's servers and delivered to users via a web browser or mobile app.

Each cloud services model offers different levels of control and flexibility, allowing organizations to choose the model that best suits their needs and requirements.

### **Service Model - SaaS**

SaaS applications are typically hosted on the cloud provider's servers and delivered to users via a web browser or mobile app. This allows organizations to quickly and easily deploy software solutions without costly hardware and IT support. SaaS applications are also highly scalable, allowing users to add or remove features as needed and pay only for what they use.

Overall, SaaS is a cost-effective and flexible solution for organizations of all sizes, providing easy access to powerful software applications without complex installation, maintenance, or support.

### **Service Model - PaaS**

With PaaS, developers can access various services, including application development frameworks, databases, middleware, and other tools needed to build, test, and deploy applications. PaaS also provides a scalable and flexible infrastructure that can easily accommodate changes in application demand without additional hardware or IT support.

PaaS benefits organizations with limited IT resources, allowing developers to focus on application development without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. In addition, PaaS enables developers to collaborate more efficiently, as they can work on the same codebase and share resources in real-time.

PaaS is a powerful and flexible application development and deployment solution, providing developers with the resources and tools they need to create and deliver applications quickly and efficiently.

### **Service Model - IaaS**

At the same time, users have complete control over the configuration and management of the virtualized resources. With IaaS, users can quickly and easily provision computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking, without expensive hardware or IT support. In addition, IaaS is highly scalable, allowing users to add or remove resources as needed and pay only for what they use.

IaaS is particularly useful for organizations that need to scale their infrastructure to quickly accommodate changes in demand or those that require a flexible and customizable infrastructure to support their unique business needs. IaaS enables users to focus on their core business rather than worrying about managing hardware and infrastructure.
