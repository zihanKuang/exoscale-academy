### **IaaS+**

Infrastructure as a Service is the cloud service model we support with the Exoscale platform and a bit more, hence, IaaS+.

### **Platform**

A state-of-the-art IaaS platform providing the building blocks for your application infrastructure.

The following questions arise if you think about the breadth of the cloud offerings in the market today:

- Why IaaS?
- Who uses IaaS?
- Why Exoscale?


#### **Why IaaS?**

It is the cloud computing model to extend or replace your data center.

Let's look at the trends of the worldwide IT infrastructure market.

The IDC figures show clearly that the infrastructure game is changing. Even though there are still markets where cloud adoption is low and slow, there is a clear trend that the public cloud will be a significant part of IT infrastructure.

**By 2028:**
- **private cloud** (cloud & dedicated) share **will grow** from 15.7% **to 16.9%**
- **public cloud** (cloud & shared) part will be **up** from 49.0% to **58.1%**
- **on-premises** part (non-cloud & dedicated) will be **down** from 35.3% **to 25.0%**

#### **Who uses IaaS?**
IaaS users, in general, are looking for TWO significant benefits:

- **MORE DYNAMIC**, servers can be started and stopped as needed without the up-front cost.
- **REDUCED COMPLEXITY**, of buying, repairing, or dealing with physical hardware.
